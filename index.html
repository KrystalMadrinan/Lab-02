            Hi! My name is Krystal. I'm originally from New York City, but I've been living in the PNW for four years
            now.
            I've attended quite a few colleges, but my last one was Oregon State University. I haven't earned a degree
            (yet?) but I have an academic background in health, math, anthropology, and sports science.

            <p>I have worked in retail, entertainment, and nightlife (as a waitress) for most of my adult life on and
                off while
                attending school. My ultimate "dream career" at the moment would be anything that would let me work
                remotely while traveling, like a digital nomad. My favorite foods are steak and salmon. I really don't enjoy okras
                or eggplants because of the texture.
            </p>
